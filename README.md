For this project, we extracted data from the General Social Survey’s 2018 responses to
discover if there is a relationship between education levels and self-reported life satisfaction
variables, such as job, social, financial, and overall life satisfaction. Out of more than 5000
variables offered in the General Social Survey that were asked, we selected variables offering
data about a respondent’s highest education level, and the satisfaction variables as
mentioned above. We performed linear regression analysis, displaying our results on scatter
plots as well as a stacked barplot, analyzing the relationship.

After our analyses, we have found a statistically significant, positive correlation between
education levels and multiple life satisfaction variables. Prior surveys have suggested that a
higher education contributes to advances in the personal success of an individual graduate,
and our project examining our sample size of 2348 respondents contributes support for this
proposal.
